I kill it cause I drop this on our anniversary Half of your friends ain't even heard of me They know me as a kid that's more close than the curtains be You want me back well that's working out perfectly Your lips are just so perfect and it hurts to be the kid that broke your heart It's not on purpose man I've done this since the nursery Do you like me? Well certainly And if she falls in love And it's kinda like a curse for me I don't say this stuff with certainty I just wanna have fun There's no need for all the urgency Cause these ladies always burning me I'm learning every time that I'm concerned it's an emergency But girl I'd rather go emergencies And feel your body cause I know you're been in surgery Girl it's been a while so now I know that you're sure with me So come and take my hand Cause I wanna be the first to be with you Broken hearts that drown in underwater Hoping I bring em up to solid ground Tryna swim ashore but it's getting so much harder Knowing that the one I love is not around I think I'm liking someone else But I don't wanna hurt you so I'm right here by myself And I think that I'm a search you on the social media Giddy up straight meeting up Chilling with your sister Bout to text you say I miss you but A joker's talking with his fists up Cause now I got you mad bout them numbers that I picked up But I ain't even messing with nobody Chest is heavy I ain't been confessing to nobody Man you know they know we broke a thing Like we see their body This girl told me she said texting me a hobby And of course Kennedy mad Man she mad all the time Like all my enemies mad She's so mad she probly tend to be mad But it's really sad for your oldest friend to be sad But at least I said all my goodbyes So she has a bit of closure in the pillow when she cries But I'm sorry Broken hearts that drown in underwater Hoping I bring em up to solid ground Tryna swim ashore but it's getting so much harder Knowing that the one I love is not around She's not around babe Tell me if it's too much Tell me if it's too much Just tell me if it's too much Tell me if it's too much Girl just tell me if it's too much I got you if it's too much You can take it off if it's too much Just tell me if it's too much We don't gotta do much Tell me if it's Thank you for coming on this dream with me through this cool tape Shut out to my mom and shout out to my dad Shout out to my sister shout out to my brother Ace Thank you to old mon for being here for the last 5 years Shout out to Stoopid Robots you guys have so many shots and my mistress all over the globe Shout to Moses and shout to Teo Thank you Heisnbod thank you rice And thank you for listening Goodbye Stoopid Robots It sounds sounds like it's raining Stop it when it rains in pours Cause it rains and pours It rains and pours Gonna see you when it rains and pours Cause it rains and pours It rains and pours Girl I notice when it rains and pours Because I see it when it rains and pours Because it rains and Girl I just wish I hold you If it's too much Then I'll just hold you and unfold you til I can find the old you And we were so connected I probly see so intected my thoughts are getting so hectic Words carefully selected Teens love each other so reckless I couldn't see where my head is Is it too much? Cause if it is we can take our broken hearts right up the stairs Ignorin all our peers We hide the fact that we some secret lovers But we show it all when me under the covers Baby girl cause If it's too much I got you if it's too much You can take it off if it's too much I got you if it's too much if it's too much If it's too much I'll put my hand right down your face and make it to your waist Baby girl cause if it's too much People have nothing to chase Only if they have no space Baby girl cause this is too much So my lips is what you'll taste And if it's too much We gon do it how we did it Up on zoomer baby girl But is it ?

Sick Contest Coming This Week Stay Tuned Of Course Writers Block Is Stupid Thats Why I Do It In My Head The Ancient Secret of the Flower of Life and ancient texts things that can’t be pre dated  It’s proven that how time moves for you depends on where you are in the universe It’s relative to beings and other places But on the level of being here on earth if you are aware in a moment one second can last a year And if you are unaware your whole childhood your whole life can pass by in six seconds But it’s also such a thing that you can get lost in Right because you have to live There’s a theoretical physicist inside all of our minds and you can talk and talk but it’s living The being one of them the melancholiness of the ocean the melancholiness of everything else As soon as me and tarted releasing music that’s one thing that the whole world took away is okay they unlocked another step of honesty If these guys can be honest about everything then we can be more honest Exactly Because your mind has a duality to it So when one thought goes into your mind it’s not just one thought it has to bounce off both hemispheres of the brain When you’re thinking about something happy you’re thinking about something sad When you think about an apple you also think about the opposite of an apple It’s a tool for understanding mathematics and things with two separate realities But for creativity That comes from a place of oneness That’s not a duality consciousness And you can’t listen to your mind in those times it’ll tell you what you think and also what other people think I think had a huge evolution That’s another thing What’s your job what’s your career?
